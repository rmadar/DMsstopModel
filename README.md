# Dark Matter Model Coupled to the Top Quark

A simplified dark matter model with a new interation field (mediator), responsible for the weak interaction between the ordinary matter and the introduced dark matter candidate. Some exploration studies are performed in order to understand how the model parameters relate to each other. The original version was written in Python and an attempt at redoing it in Go is done.
